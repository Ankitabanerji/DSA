"""The reason we use current.copy() (or list(current)) is to prevent future modifications from affecting the subsets we've already stored.
Here's the issue:
- In Python, lists are mutable and passed by reference.
- If you just append(current) into result, you're appending a reference to the same current list â€” not a snapshot of it at that time.
- So later, when you modify current (e.g., by .pop()), it would also modify the subset already saved inside result, which is not what you want.
By doing current.copy(), you make a new independent list at that moment."""
